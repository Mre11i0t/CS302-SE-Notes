# SCRUM

**Agile** methodology framework for developing, delivering and maintaining software products.

**Iterative** approach towards software development.

Scrum is defined by the following sections.

### Roles

**Scrum Teams**: Organisation is split into small, cross-functioning, self-organising teams. These teams are also responsible for the software deliverable (**in shippable increments**) and consist of its contributors.

**Scrum Master**: Facilitator who removes impediments and hosts meetings. Ensures team adheres to scrum practices. **NOT** a manager.

**Product/Project Owner**: Voice or representative of the team. Creates and manages the product backlog.

### Artifacts

Split the work into small, concrete deliverables. Sort them by priority and estimate the relative effort.

**Product Backlog**: List of features used to describe a product.

**User Stories**: Features.

The scrum team estimates the work for each user story and sorts them by priority.
This results in the formation of a **roadmap**.

**Sprint Backlog**: Features or stories planned for the sprint.

### Events

Time is split is into short, fixed-length duration of 2-4 weeks and is called a **sprint**. Potentially shippable code is to be developed at the end of each sprint.

Total effort each iteration (sprint) takes is dependent on the user stories per iteration.
There can be multiple iterations per release.

**Sprint Planning Meeting**: Meeting used to decide on which of the product backlogs to be worked on for the duration of the sprint.

**Sprint review**: Used to demonstrate story features. Product owner evaluates the features against the desired criteria. Gets feedback from clients to ensure delivered increment needs their business needs.

**Sprint Retrospective**: Final team meeting to discuss the duration of the sprint, discuss what went well, what did not and how to improve.
