# Requirement Engineering

## Requirements Elicitation

Process of working with all stakeholders, gathering and understanding their needs, dealing with potential conflicts and thereby establishing a **clear scope and boundary** for this project.

Involves:

- Understanding the problem and domain.
- Identifying clear objectives.
- Understanding needs and constraints of the stakeholders.

### Elicitation Techniques

#### Active

There is ongoing interaction between stakeholders and users. Some examples are:

- Facilitated-Meetings
- Interviews
- Prototypes
- Scenarios

#### Passive

Infrequent interaction between stakeholders and users. Some examples are:

- Questionnares
- Checklists
- Documentation

## Requirements Analysis

- Understand the requirements in depth, both from a product and process perspective.
- Reorganise and resolve the conflicts.
- Prioritise the requirements. **MoSCoW**: Must have, should have, could have and won't have.
- Decide on Build or Buying and optimising for necessary requirements.

### Use Case Diagrams

![Use Case Diagram](images/usecase.png)

- From a user's point of view, outlines how the proposed system will perform a task while responding to certain actions or requests.
- Can also be viewed as a sequence of actions a system is expected to perform to yield an observable result of value.
- Used to visualise and document the intended behaviour of a system during requirements analysis.

## Requirements Specification

- Documentation of a set of requirements that is reviewed and approved by the customer for the next stage.
- Basis for what the customers and contractors decided what to implement and what to not implement.

Documentation is required for the following reasons:

- Team Communication
- Maintainance and Evolution
- Formalisation leads to better clarity of points.
- Visibility for better project plan

Characteristics of documentation:

- Accurate and up to date.  
- Simple but professional.
- Maintained online.
- Appropriate for audience

### Software Requirement Specification (SRS)

- **Functionality**: What the software does
- **External Interfaces**: How the software interacts with other interfaces, people and devices.
- **Non-Functionality**: All of the quality criterias which drive the functionality such as performance, availability, portability, etc.

## Requirements Validation

- Purpose is to ensure that the requirement does what the customer wants it to do.
- Very important as repairing requirements errors later can be very expensive.
- **Validation**: Ensures that the requirements specified will solve the right problems and satisfy user needs.
- **Verification**: Determines whether requirements have been specified correctly.

### Prototyping

- Facilitates user involvement in design phase and ensures engineers have the correct understanding of the requirements.
- Systems with very less or no user interaction may not benefit as much from prototyping.

### Model Validation

- Ensures that the model has all the essential requirements.
- Fishbone Analysis technique is used to validate requirements.

### Acceptance Criteria

- Use `Acceptance Criteria` to see if all the requirements match with the acceptance criteria.

## Requirements Management

Baseline on which future lifecycles rely on.

Requirements can change due to:

- Changing customer demands.
- Better understanding of the problem.
- Evolving environment and technology.

Requirements management:

- Ensures that the requirements are met in each lifecycle phase.
- Ensures that changes in requirements are handled appropriately.

Uncontrolled changes can have adverse effects. Changes must be controlled and must be prepared for.
