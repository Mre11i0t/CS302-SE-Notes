# Agile

## Limitations of Legacy Lifecycles:

- Upfront planning.
- Good when there is a definitive idea of what needs to be implemented with limited changes.
- Do not facilitate periodic customer interactions (changing customer requirements).
- Suited for large projects with complex dependencies.

## Agile

**Agile** is an **umbrella term** used to describe a variety of methods that entail:

- Continual realignment of development goals to coincide with changing customer requirements.
- Aimed at reducing massive planning overhead and to allow fast reactions to change.

## Agile Manifesto:

- Individuals and interactions **over** processes and tools.
- Working Software **over** comprehensive documentation.
- Customer collaboration **over** contract negotiation.
- Responding to change **over** following a plan.
- Focus on simplicity in **both** the product and the process.

| Pros | Cons |
| ---- | ---- |
|Realistic approach to Software Development (being flexible to change).| Cannot handle complex dependencies.|
|Resource requirements are minimum. | An overall plan, Agile leader and Agile PM are necessary for it to work. |
|Suitable for changing requirements. | Depends heavily on customer interaction. If customer is not clear, can lead to development in the wrong direction. |
|Little or no planning required. | Very high individual dependency, leading to very less documentation. |
|Good for environments that change steadily. | Transfer of tech to new team members will be touch due to lack of sufficient documentation. |
