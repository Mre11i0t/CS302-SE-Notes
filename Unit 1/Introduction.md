# Introduction

**Software** is the collection of executable code, configuration files and associated libraries along with documentation serving a computational purpose.

**Software Product** is software made for a specific or a group of specific requirements.

**Engineering** is acquiring and using well-defined scientific principles and systematic methods for developing products, with economic sense, social perspective and practicality in mind.

## Software Engineering

**Software Engineering** is the systematic, disciplined and quantifiable approach to the development, maintenance and operations of software products.

A Software Product developed using Software Engineering principles has a **higher probability** of being **more efficient and reliable**.

It drives the usage of **appropriate tools and techniques** while taking into account the constraints and resources availanle.

## Software Engineering vs Computer Science

- **Software Engineering** focuses on technical and managerial leadership of large and complex systems.

- **Computer Science** focuses on foundations of computing such as theoy of computation, data structures, algorithms, etc.


## Fundamental Drivers of Software Engineering

1) **Industrial Strength Software**: Software needs to be maintainable (modular), portable and operational. Should also have elaborate documentation.

2) **Software is Expensive**: Software Development is labour expensive. Maintainance or Rework of code will be **very expensive**.

3) **Late and Unreliable**

4) **Can influence the life and lead to death of a person**: various instances of software bugs leading to loss of life or severe degradation of quality of life.

5) **Heterogenity:** Systems are required to operated on networks or distributed systems that contain various kinds of devices.

6) **Diversity**: Various kinds of software leading to different techniques, methods and tools.

7) **Business and Social Change**: Organisations need to keep up with the rapid development and adapt their software.   

8) **Security and Trust**: Essential to have trust in the software being built.

9) **Scale**: Software Development needs to have the ability to scale with size and complexity.

10) **Quality and Productivity**: To build quality software products while maximising productivity.

11) **Consistency and Repeatability**
