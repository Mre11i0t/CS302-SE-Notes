# Software Project Monitoring and Control

Begins once the project plan is created.

It is continuously performed and uses all the measures and metrics to ensure that the project is happening **on-time, within the budget and with minimal risk**.

Involves **Quantitative** data that is being continuously collected.

Involves making decisions about adjustments in time, money, organisational structure, scope, etc.

Project Control Dimensions:

- Time, both in terms of effort and schedule. 
**Brooks' Law**: Adding more people to a late project delays it further.

- Communication includes good documentation. Agile focuses on knowledge held by people, not on documentation.

- Organisation and its structure, roles and responsibilities assigned to people.

- Quality. It is not an add-on feature, has to be built-in. Requires frequent interaction with stakeholders.

- Cost, infrastructure and personnel. 

## Project Closure

Will formally close the project and report its level of success.

Steps involved:

- Hand over deliverables and obtain UAT (User Acceptance Testing) to indicate all the objectives and requirements have been met.
- Complete documentation and cancel supplier contracts.
- Release employees and equipment from the project.
- Post Implementation review to determine success and what was learnt.
