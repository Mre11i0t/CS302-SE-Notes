# Software Project Planning

Initiation and approval of the project typically happens at the end of the feasibility study.

**Planning**: It is one of the first tasks and involves the Product Manager (PM) focusing on what needs to be achieved and how.
It involves looking ahead and obtaining the resources necessary so that the project will be executed smoothly.
Outcome of the planning phase is usually a **Project Plan**.
